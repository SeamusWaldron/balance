## About

Mondrian spent his career seeking perfect balance—the point where a composition achieves stillness. In *Balance*, you inherit that quest.

The canvas drifts toward disorder. Colors carry weight. Lines shift under pressure. Your task is to maintain equilibrium through subtle adjustments, or watch the composition collapse into rigidity.

## Modes

**Balance** — A meditation on visual weight. The canvas drifts gently, like a mobile turning in still air. There is no urgency, only the slow pull of gravity on pigment.

**Equilibrium** — A negotiation with entropy. The canvas resists your arrangements with gathering force. The question is not whether the system will fail, but how long you can hold it together.

## The Painting

*Composition with Red, Blue and Yellow* (1930) exemplifies Mondrian's Neo-Plasticism: primary colors, black lines, white space, and the pursuit of universal harmony through asymmetrical balance. The painting entered the public domain on January 1, 2026.
